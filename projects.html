            <h1>Expense</h1>
            <h3>React: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                Expense is a budgeting web app, where users can manage their finances. <br />
                Some features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting monthly spending limits</li>
                <li>Managing progress towards spending limit</li>
                <li>Logging transactions</li>
                <li>Visualizing expense trends</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Key takeway:</strong>
              Thinking away from the keyboard and carefully mapping out relationships
              between components before diving into code not only results in more efficient code, but it also avoids a lot of
              debugging headaches.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Next steps:</strong>
              Implement server side with Express, Node.js, and MongoDB (MERN stack).

        <h1>Personal Website</h1>
        <h3>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            This website! <br />
            As my first experience with Web Development, I made this website from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key takeway:</strong>
          I should use frameworks like React to modularize HTML, reuse code, and more easily create interactive components.
          Also, a clear mark up helps with UI design and simplifies CSS by using fewer classes.

      <div class="project">
        <h1>2D Maze Game</h1>
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>
          This was the final project of CS61B, and it involves generating a random closed world with rooms and connecting hallways.
          The world included a torch feature, that displayed only a small radius of the world around the player and the objective
          of the game was to navigate through the maze to reach a target at the other side. This project involved graph algorithms
          and data structures (can't give away too much information here for future students).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key takeway:</strong>
          Plan, plan, plan! As a partner project, it was even more crucial that we shared a clear understanding of our implementation.
          We spent hours drawing out different algorithms and writing pseudocode, which made dividing the tasks easier and avoided conflicting code.
        </p>

      <div class="project">
        <h1>Virtual Reality Research</h1>
        <h3>Unity3D, C#</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida, I conducted a study with over 100 participants
          and showcased the results in a research paper, a poster, and a presentation to other Engineering students, professors, post docs, and counselors.
          I explored whehter voice or animations is more responsible for the human resemblance of virtual humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key takeway:</strong>
          True research takes many years of diving deep into the field in order to know enough to tackle the unknown.
          I spent weeks reading countless papers about the field before I finally formed my research topic taking inspiration from a paper describing the
          qualities responsible for the human resemblance of virtual humans.

        <h1>Tutortime</h1>
        <p>
            Tutortime is a Bay Area tutoring organization that connects academically talented high school tutors with students, effectively meeting
            needs for affordable tutoring and job experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key takeway:</strong>
          Respond to customers ASAP. It reinforces the legitimacy of the organization and keeps their interest in using your services.
